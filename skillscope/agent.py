"""Agent staging and grading for behavioral eval runs.

One skill is copied into an isolated temp workspace, one prompt is run to
completion, and the result is graded against a case's expectations::

    from skillscope.agent import claude

    with claude("opus", skill="local-ai-use") as agent:
        run = agent.prompt("Use local AI, then generate a cat to out.png.")
        checks = run.evaluate(
            files_exist=["out.png"],
            expected_behavior=["Download the SD-Turbo model"],
            unexpected_behavior=["Use the GenerateImage tool"],
        )

``evaluate`` reports every expectation instead of raising at the first
failure, because a run that took minutes and real tokens should not have to
be repeated to discover the second thing wrong with it. The asserting
variants (``logs_contains``, ``expects``, ...) are still here for skills whose
``evals/hooks.py`` needs to express a check the dataset format cannot.

Two things are deliberately *not* graded here. Routing is not: behavioral
installs a single skill, so "did the right one fire" is unanswerable and
belongs to routing, which installs several at once. And nothing checks
that the skill name appears in the transcript, which was the old stand-in for
a routing assertion and only ever proved the staged skill was visible.
